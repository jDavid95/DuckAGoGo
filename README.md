This is the first version of DuckAGoGo for now only supports quick searches, which means it will only fetch results for those searches that have abstracts in their results. 

## Usage
To run just ```./DuckAGoGo``` and it will enter in prompt mode. From here you can start typing your query or if you would like to enter the translation mode just simple type ```translate```. To exit the original DuckAGoGo prompt simply type exit.
